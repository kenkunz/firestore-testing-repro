# firestore-testing-repro

## Overview

See: [firebase-js-sdk issue #5825](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/5825)

This repository demonstrates a bug with `@firebase/rules-unit-testing` and/or
`firebase-js-sdk/firestore` (incompatibility between the two).

With `@firebase/rules-unit-testing@2.0.1` and `firebase >=9.0.0 <=9.1.3`, the test utilities work
whether loaded as a cjs require or an es6 module. After upgrading to `firebase >=9.2.0`, the
utilities no longer work when loaded as es6 module, but still work when loaded with cjs require.

## Steps to reproduce

1. install dependency: [Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure)
1. clone this repository and install npm modules
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kenkunz/firestore-testing-repro.git
   cd firestore-testing-repro
   npm install
   ```
1. run the tests
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
   Note that both `test.js` and `test.cjs` complete successfully

1. upgrade to `firebase@9.2.0` (or greater)
   ```bash
   npm i -D firebase@9.2.0
   ```
1. run the tests again
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
   Note that `test.cjs` still passes but `test.js` fails (see error output below)

## Error output
